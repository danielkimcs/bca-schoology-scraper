# Schoology Scraper for Bergen County Academies

Uses RoboBrowser, BeautifulSoup for web scraping.

Generate list of students (any grade) for every possible class, even classes you are not in (which cannot be accessed on Schoology by normal means).

Done by scraping information of courses taken by each current student in BCA, using RoboBrowser and BeautifulSoup.

Disclaimer: This works specifically for the Schoology website of my high school, Bergen County Academies; I can't guarantee that it works for other high schools.
